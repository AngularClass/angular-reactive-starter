# Angular2 Reactive Starter [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

> A starter kit featuring [Angular 2](https://angular.io), [Router](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/api/router/), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) by [AngularClass](https://angularclass.com).
If you're looking for Angular 1.x please use [NG6-starter](https://github.com/angular-class/NG6-starter)

This repo serves as an extremely minimal starter for anyone looking to get up and running with Angular 2 and TypeScript. Using a [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for building our files and assisting with boilerplate.
* Best practice in file organization for Angular 2.
* Ready to go build system using Webpack for working with TypeScript.

### Quick start
> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/components/app.ts`](https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/src/app/components/app.ts)

```bash
$ npm start
```


## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
angular2-webpack-starter/
--public/ * static assets are served here
----lib/ * static libraries
------traceur.min.js * ignore this file for now as it's required by Angular 2
----favicon.ico * replace me with your own favicon.ico
----index.html * where we place our script tags
----robots.txt * for search engines to crawl your website
----human.txt * for humans to know who the developers are
----service-worker.js * ignore this. Web App service worker that's not complete yet
--src/ * our source files that will be compiled
----app/
------bootstrap.ts * entry file for app
------components/ * where most of components live
--------app.ts * entry file for components
--------dashboard.ts * A simple Component with a simple Directive examples
--------home/ * example component as a folder
----------home.ts * how you would require your template and style files
----------home.css * simple css file for home styles
----------home.html * simple html file for home template
----services/ * where we keep our services used throughout our app
----directives/ * where we keep our directives used throughout our app
----common/ * where common files used throughout our app
------checkIfShadowDom.ts * Determind if the user is on chrome and use ShadowDom
------BrowserDomAdapter.ts * ignore this. we need to set the DomAdapter to the browser
----custom_typings/ * where we define our custom types
------ng2.d.ts * where we patch angular2 types with our own until it's fixed
--typings/ * where tsd defines it's types definitions
--tsconfig.json * config that webpack uses for typescript
--tsd.json * config that tsd uses for managing it's definitions
--package.json * what npm uses to manage it's dependencies
--webpack.config.js * our webpack config
```

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v0.12.2`+ and NPM `2.10.0`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install -global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install -global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install -global webpack-dev-server`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `npm run server` to start the server

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.
 
### server
```bash
$ npm run server
```

### build files
```bash
$ npm run build
```

### watch and build files
```bash
$ npm run watch
```

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 1.5 beta includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

    $ npm install -global typescript@^1.5.0-beta

## .d.ts Typings
The typings in `typings/` are partially autogenerated, partially hand
written. All the symbols should be present, but probably have wrong paramaters
and missing members. Modify them as you go.

    $ npm install -global tsd
 > You may need to require `reference path` for your editor to autocomplete correctly
 ```
 /// <reference path="../../typings/tsd.d.ts" />
 /// <reference path="../custom_typings/ng2.d.ts" />
 ```
 Otherwise including them in `tsd.json` is prefered 

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)


### Todo
* production/development environments
* testing
* e2e
* production services examples
* hot-component-reloading
